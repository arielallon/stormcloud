# Stormcloud
This is Stormcloud. [It used to be pretty popular](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/07/revive-stormcloud-typhoon-linux-weather-app). However, **it is no longer under active development**.

There are two versions here, the desktop version for Ubuntu & Chrome, and the mobile version for Windows Phone 8 & Firefox OS (whoops, both dead platforms). The mobile version is newer, has much better code quality, more settings, and more fancy features. I would recommend using this codebase if you want to either revive Stormcloud, or roll bits of it into your own app.
